\section{Introduction}

This model of tree physiology designed to illuminate the paths a tree may follow to mortality under drought.  It is based largely on hypotheses proposed in \citet{McDowell2011} that xylem failure and carbon starvation may exhibit positive feedbacks on one another and lead to tree death via either mechanism or vulnerability to pathogens.  The purpose of creating the model is to identify  conditions under which trees die of each mechanism, as well as explore the behavior of the model near critical water levels so as to generate hypotheses of potential warning signals for tree death.

\section{Model Definition}

The current model is at the scale of a single tree with no branching structure (a "tube" model).  The time scale is daily - changes in stomatal conductance, xylem conductance and pressure are assumed to occur instantaneously, while differential equations define changes in carbon flow and damage to the xylem.

Soil water potenial $\Psi_s$ (in MPa) and leaf surface moisture deficit $D$ (in MPa) are driven exogenously and for now do not change:
\begin{equation}\label{Psi_s}
\frac{d\Psi_s}{dt} = 0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{sD}
\frac{dD}{dt} = 0
\end{equation}
Evapotranspiration $E$ is equal to both water transport through the xylem and leaf water conductance:

\begin{equation}\label{E}
E = GD = K\underbrace{(\Psi_s - \Psi_l - h\rho g)}_{\Delta\Psi \; = \;xylem\;  pressure}
\end{equation}
Here $G$ is canopy stomatal conductance (mmol s-1 MPa-1), $K$ is xylem conductance (mmol s-1 MPa-1), $\Psi_l$ is leaf water potential (MPa), $h$ is canopy height, $\rho$ the density of water, and $g$ the force of gravity.

The tree is assumed to regulate stomatal conductance $G$ instantaneously in response to xylem pressure
\begin{equation}\label{G}
G = G_{max} - \frac{-\Delta\Psi}{g_s}
\end{equation}

I combine \eqref{E} and \eqref{G} to solve for xylem pressure:

\begin{equation}\label{DPsi}
\Delta\Psi = \frac{DG_{max}}{K - D/g_s}
\end{equation}

Where $G_{max}$ is the maximum stomatal conductance (mmol s-1 MPa-1) and $g_s$ is the stomatal closure factor.

Xylem conductance $K$ is reduced when the xylem is damaged by embolism.  This occurs via a Weibull function

\begin{equation}\label{dK}
\frac{dK}{dt} = -K(\frac{k_K}{\lambda_K})(\frac{-\Delta\Psi}{\lambda_K})^{k_K-1}e^{-(\Delta\Psi/\lambda_K)^{k_K}} + \theta R
\end{equation}
where $\lambda_K$ and $k_K$ are dimensionless scale and shape parameters for the conductance Weibull function, $R$ is carbon allocation to xylem repair (g d-1), and $\theta$ is the efficacy of repair (mmol s-1 MPa-1 d-1 g-1)

The tree's store of non-structural carbohydrates $S$ (in g) changes according to four metabolic processes:
\begin{equation}\label{dS}
\frac{dS}{dt} = P - R - M - B
\end{equation}
where $P$ is photosynthesis, $R$ is xylem repair, $M$ is maintenance respiration, and $B$ is growth, all in grams per day.  Photosynthesis is assumed to be limited only by flow of CO2 through the stomata:
\begin{equation}\label{P}
P = \alpha G
\end{equation}
$\alpha$ is the photosynthetic coefficient (g s MPa mmol-1 d-1)

Xylem repair $R$ is driven both by level of xylem damage and availability of sugars.
\begin{equation}\label{R}
R = \beta S (1 - K/K_{max})
 \end{equation}
 $\beta$ is the repair coefficent (g g-1 d-1) and $K_{max}$ is the maximum xylem conductance

Maintenance respiration $M$ is constant
\begin{equation}\label{M}
M = m
\end{equation}
 
The tree can regulate growth $B$ according to sugar availability and water stress
 \begin{equation}\label{B}
 B = \gamma S e^{-(-\Delta\Psi/\lambda_B)^{k_B}}
\end{equation}
$\gamma$ is the growth coefficient (g g-1 d-1), and $\lambda_B$ and $k_B$ are dimensionless scale and shape parameters for the Weibull function regulating growth.   
 
\section{Simulations}
I've implemented this model in R and have begun to explore the parameter space.  Here is one example run:

\section{Questions to Address}
 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Does the model reproduce the patterns summarized in \citet{McDowell2011}, namely, carbohydrate storage rising intially under drought before decline?
  \item What factors cause death to occur via total xylem failure vs. exhaustion of carbohydrates (carbon starvation)?
  \item What are other appropriate functions for stomatal control and growth?  How is the model sensitive to changes in the forms of these equations?  Should stomatal growth be controlled by xylem pressure or leaf water potential?
  \item Are there bifurcations in behavior as water availability changes?
  \item What happens when we drive the model with changing water availability?
\end{enumerate}
  
\section{Tasks}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Standardize and document the code better
  \item Set up a run environment for better documentation/graphing
  \item Start hunting for parameter values
  \item Do a phase-plane diagram
  \item Write up a lit review including (a) mortality mechanisms and (b) stomatal control
\end{enumerate}
